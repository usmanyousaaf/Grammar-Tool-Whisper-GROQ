# Grammar and Vocabulary Checker with Audio Transcription 🎙️✍️

This project integrates **audio transcription** and **grammar & vocabulary checking** features, powered by **Whisper** for transcription and **GROQ** for analysis. The tool allows you to transcribe audio recordings, check grammar and vocabulary, and receive a score for both.
